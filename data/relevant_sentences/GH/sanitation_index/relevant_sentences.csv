In the 1990s, it became known for its high levels of pollution. It dredged the water body and raised the level of some nearby land, to reduce the risk of flooding, then established industries on surrounding drained and reclaimed land—initially brewing and food processing, later car repairs and then electronic scrap processing at Agbogbloshie. The most important destination of stormwater runoff, the river also became highly polluted with waste, which was discharged into the lagoon. The combination of waste from the Odaw River and industries and settlements on the shores of the lagoon led, by 2002, to it being described as ""one of the most polluted water bodies on earth"".
